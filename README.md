# Stochastic-Signal-Analysis--EEG

Key Features:

AR Model Simulation: Generate synthetic time-series data based on user-defined AR coefficients.

Model Order Estimation: Use AIC to determine the optimal order for AR models.

Power Spectral Analysis: Estimate and visualize the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of signals.

EEG Signal Analysis: Analyze brain rhythms in EEG signals across various frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Delta, etc.).

This project bridges theoretical concepts with practical signal analysis, providing insights into signal processing applications in neuroscience, communications, and time-series forecasting.
