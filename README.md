# **Stochastic Signal Analysis with AR Models**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing stochastic processes using Auto-Regressive (AR) models in MATLAB. It involves AR model simulation, spectral density estimation, model order selection with AIC, and EEG signal analysis to identify brain rhythms across frequency bands.

---

## **Features**
- **AR Model Simulation**: Generate and visualize synthetic time series.
- **Model Order Estimation**: Use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the optimal AR order.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Compute and visualize Power Spectral Density (PSD) using AR models.
- **EEG Signal Processing**: Analyze EEG signals and identify brain rhythms (Alpha, Beta, etc.).

---

## **Technologies**
- MATLAB for simulations, spectral analysis, and EEG signal processing.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- MATLAB installed with the Signal Processing Toolbox.

### **Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Stochastic-Signal-Analysis.git
   cd Stochastic-Signal-Analysis
   ```
2. Add the EEG data (`eeg1.mat`) and synthetic data (`synthetic_data.mat`) to the `data/` folder.

### **Running the Scripts**
1. **Simulate AR Model**:
   Run `src/ar_model_simulation.m` to generate synthetic time series data and visualize it.
2. **Model Order Estimation**:
   Run `src/aic_evaluation.m` to calculate the AIC and find the optimal AR order.
3. **Spectral Analysis**:
   Execute `src/spectral_analysis.m` to estimate the PSD of AR-generated signals.
4. **EEG Analysis**:
   Use `src/eeg_analysis.m` to analyze EEG signals and compute spectral densities.
